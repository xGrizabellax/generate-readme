  ## Installation:
  Must have inquirer installed. The utility files are two node files called "generateMarkdown.js" and "index.js". The former file creates functions that are used to create the .md file. These functions must be exported and then required in the index.js file. Index.js also needs to require filesystem as it uses fs to "writeFile" which writes your README.md in proper Markdown format. It is very important as well that once everything is installed, that a .gitignore file is created and you put your "node_modules" file inside of it immediately.

  ## Usage:
  For creating a very descriptive, well-organized README.md file for your project. The README explains everything other users need to know about your project.

  ## Contributing:
  Just be respectful and have fun! If you have any creative/innovative ideas to make this README generator more effective, please contribute your ideas. Let's work together to make a great README machine that thoroughly details whatever it is you're working on.

  ## Tests:
  If you want to try it out, simply run "node index.js" through the terminal. After answering the questions, your README.md file will be created in the same root you are working from. You can further examine the README file in its markdown format and make any changes to it. Otherwise, if you would like to see the finished README in all its glory, just create a new repository, put all of the generator's files into it, and push the repository on up to GitHub. There you can see the finished final product.
