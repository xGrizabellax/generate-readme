  ## Installation:
  Run npm i in your command line. It will probably be helpful to have a split terminal with mysql running in the other as well. Take the code from your schema.sql file and run it in your SQL terminal to create your database. Now you can input 'node ./seeds/index.js' into your main terminal. 

  ## Usage:
  After installing, make sure you have an API testing tool such as Insomnia or Postman installed. These will be used for all of your requests such as GET, POST, PUT, and  DELETE. Follow the correct routes for the according Models when you submit a request.
